downsample_csv.py

Downsample a CSV file containing time-series trajectory data.

This script supports two main operations:
1. Simple downsampling by selecting every N-th row (commented out in this version).
2. Time-based downsampling by creating target timestamps at fixed intervals
    (e.g., 0.1 seconds) and selecting the closest available row from the original data.

Steps performed:
- Load the original CSV file.
- Convert timestamps from microseconds to seconds.
- Generate target timestamps at uniform intervals.
- Find the closest row in the original data for each target timestamp.
- Save the downsampled result to a new CSV file.

The resulting CSV is suitable for downstream processing, such as trajectory
prediction or analysis where uniform time intervals are required.
